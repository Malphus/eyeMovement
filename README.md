# eyeMovement
This is a page with eyes on it that the eyeball moves with the movement of the mouse.  The assignment called for adding 1 eye to the one that was already there and I have added a 3rd eye.

HOW TO RUN: Download all associated files and run the html file in a web browser.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENT: I would like to make this more like an eye factory so there is a button to add eyes that will follow the mouse.  I'm not sure if I want them to be evenly spaced or random.  I would also like to change the background color based on how many eyes are on the page.
